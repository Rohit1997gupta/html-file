            Hi. This isn’t the first time we’ve interrupted your reading recently, but 98% of our readers don't donate. Many think they’ll give later, but then forget. This Saturday we request you to protect Wikipedia. All we ask is ₹ 25, or whatever seems right to you, to sustain our future. We request you: Please don't scroll away. If you are one of our rare donors, we warmly thank you.
